# Purpose & Scope

## Mission Statement

The WebGrip Infrastructure repository serves as the **centralized foundation** for our organization's CI/CD infrastructure, providing specialized Docker images and automation workflows that enable consistent, reliable, and efficient development and deployment processes across all WebGrip projects.

## Primary Objectives

### 🎯 **Standardization**
Provide consistent, well-tested environments for development, testing, and deployment across all WebGrip projects. Each Docker image encapsulates specific tooling and configurations needed for different stages of our software lifecycle.

### 🚀 **Efficiency** 
Reduce setup time and eliminate "works on my machine" issues by providing pre-configured environments that developers can use immediately without lengthy local setup procedures.

### 🔧 **Automation**
Enable automated building, testing, and deployment workflows through specialized container images that integrate seamlessly with GitHub Actions and Kubernetes infrastructure.

### 📈 **Scalability**
Support the growing needs of WebGrip's development teams with infrastructure that can handle multiple projects, different technology stacks, and varying deployment requirements.

## Scope & Boundaries

### ✅ **In Scope**

**Docker Images for CI/CD**
- Development environments (Rust CI Runner)
- Testing infrastructure (Playwright Runner)
- Deployment tooling (Helm Deploy)
- Automation runners (GitHub Actions Runner, ACT Runner)
- Release processes (Rust Releaser)

**Automation Workflows**
- Automated Docker image building and publishing
- Version management and tagging
- Multi-platform build support

**Testing Infrastructure**
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Local workflow testing with ACT

**Documentation & Standards**
- Comprehensive usage documentation
- Best practices and conventions
- Architectural decision records

### ❌ **Out of Scope**

**Application Code**
- Business logic or application-specific code
- Project-specific deployment configurations
- Individual project dependencies

**Production Infrastructure**
- Kubernetes cluster management
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Database administration
- Network configuration

**Security Management**
- Secrets management (beyond basic container security)
- Access control policies
- Compliance frameworks

## Target Audiences

### 👨‍💻 **Developers**
- Need consistent development environments
- Want to test GitHub Actions workflows locally
- Require reliable CI/CD tooling

### 🔧 **DevOps Engineers**  
- Manage deployment pipelines
- Maintain CI/CD infrastructure
- Optimize build and deployment processes

### 🧪 **QA Engineers**
- Run end-to-end tests consistently
- Need reliable testing environments
- Validate deployment processes

### 📚 **New Team Members**
- Need to understand our infrastructure
- Want quick onboarding to development processes
- Require clear documentation and examples

## Value Proposition

### For Individual Developers
- **Faster Onboarding**: Get productive immediately with pre-configured environments
- **Consistent Experience**: Same tooling and versions across all environments
- **Local Testing**: Test CI/CD workflows locally before pushing changes

### For Development Teams
- **Reduced Friction**: Eliminate environment-specific issues
- **Better Collaboration**: Shared understanding of infrastructure and processes
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent testing and deployment practices

### For WebGrip Organization
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced setup time and infrastructure maintenance overhead
- **Risk Reduction**: Standardized, tested infrastructure components
- **Faster Delivery**: Streamlined development and deployment processes

## Success Metrics

We measure the success of this infrastructure through:

- **Onboarding Time**: New developers productive within hours, not days
- **Build Reliability**: >99% success rate for automated builds
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on development experience
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Minimal time spent on environment issues

## Integration Points

This infrastructure integrates with:

- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD platform using our runner images
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment target using Helm Deploy image  
- **Docker Registry**: Image storage and distribution
- **Backstage**: Service catalog and documentation platform
- **Individual Projects**: Consumed as base images and tools

---

> **Assumption**: Teams are primarily using GitHub for source control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. If teams need integration with other platforms (GitLab, Jenkins, etc.), this would require extending our image set or creating new specialized images.
